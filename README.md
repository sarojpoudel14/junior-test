Task: Mini E-Commerce App Development - Skill Test

Overview:
The goal of this project is to build a mini e-commerce app using Vue.js 3 and the FakeStore API. The app should include product listing, a product details page, and a shopping cart feature.

- Create a Home page that fetches and displays products from the FakeStore API in a grid layout.
- Build a reusable `ProductCard` component to show product details like image, title, price, and a "View Details" button.
- Create a dynamic Product Details page using Vue Router (`/product/:id`) that fetches product-specific details from the FakeStore API.
- Add a search bar on the Home page to filter products by name or category dynamically.
- Implement error handling for API failures or no search results.
- Implement a shopping cart to add/remove products, using Pinia or a custom store for state management.
- Create a `/cart` route to display selected items and total price.
- Finalize the UI with navigation, responsive design, and user-friendly layout.
- Test and optimize the app for smooth functionality.

Evaluation Criteria:
- Code Quality: Component structure, modularity, and reusability.
- Functionality: Meets requirements and handles errors gracefully.
- State Management: Effective cart functionality and state handling.
- UI/UX: Visually appealing and responsive design.
- Time Management: Timely completion of tasks.
